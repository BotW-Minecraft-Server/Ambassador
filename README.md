# Ambassador

This is a Velocity plugin that makes it possible to host a modern Forge server behind a Velocity proxy!

Unlike other solutions, this plugin does not require any special modifications to the backend server nor the client. (The player doesn't need to do anything)

## How to get started:
### On the Velocity proxy side:
1. Download and install this plugin to your proxy.
2. After starting the server, configure the plugin it to your liking using the config file found in the folder "Ambassador".
3. If you want to use modern forwarding you can use this mod on the Forge server: https://github.com/adde0109/Proxy-Compatible-Forge

## Features
* Server switching using kick to reset the client with configureble message and switch timeout.
* Server switching using client mod for instant server switching: https://github.com/Just-Chaldea/Forge-Client-Reset-Packet
